# Public Lock (Unlock Protocol) Modules

This repo contains a Hats Protocol module that adds a subscription to a hat using [Unlock Protocol](https://github.com/unlock-protocol/unlock). The latest version uses [Unlock V14](https://docs.unlock-protocol.com/core-protocol/public-lock/#version-14).

## Overview and Usage

The Public Lock V14 module enables an organization to require that a user pay a subscription in order to wear a given hat.

It creates a tight coupling between the hat and a lock. When the module is deployed, it creates a new lock contract. The module sets itself as a hook on the lock contract, which is called whenever a key is purchased from the lock contract.

When users purchase a key, they are also automatically minted the hat. To remain eligible for the hat, they must maintain their subscription to the key.

The module must serve as both a Hats eligibility module and a hatter contract. To mint the target hat when a user purchases a new key, it must be an amin of hte target hat — i.e. wear one of the target hat's admin hats — which makes it a hatter contract. To control eligibility for the target hat, it must also be set as the eligibility module for the target hat.
